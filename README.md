# Nitrogen6x Gadget Snap

This repository contains the source for an Ubuntu Core gadget snap
for the Nitrogen6x. Building it with snapcraft will
automatically pull, configure, patch and build the git.denx.de/u-boot.git
upstream source for `nitrogen6q_defconfig` at release `v2018.11` and produce
a bootable gadget snap with the resulting binaries.

## Gadget Snaps
